Question 1: Palindrome String Check
• Requirement: Use an infinite while loop to allow input of a string → Output whether the string
is a palindrome or not. Ask the user whether they want to continue. If yes, input a new string;
otherwise, exit and display a thank-you message.

Question 2: Optimize String Program
• Requirement: A string is considered optimized when: it contains no redundant spaces, and
words are separated by a single space.

Question 3: String Splitting and Processing
• Requirement: Given a string like "5;7;8;-2;8;11;13;9;10" (can be input from the keyboard):
• Output each number on a separate line
• Output how many even numbers there are
• Output how many negative numbers there are
• Output how many prime numbers there are
• Calculate and output the average value


Question 4: String Processing with Basic Functions
• Requirement: Write a program that allows input of a string. The program must output:
• Number of uppercase letters
• Number of lowercase letters
• Number of digits
• Number of special characters
• Number of whitespace characters
• Number of vowels
• Number of consonants

Question 5: Extract Negative Numbers from String
• Requirement: Write a function named NegativeNumberInStrings(str). This function takes
any input string and prints out all the negative integers contained within it.
Example: If the input string is "abc-5xyz-12k9l--p", the function should output the two
negative numbers: -5 and -12.


Question 6: Optimize Noun Phrase String
• Requirement: Write a program to optimize a noun phrase string. A string is considered
optimized when: it contains no redundant spaces, words are separated by a single space, and
the first letter of each word is capitalized.
Example:
Input: " nGUYễn KháNh SƠN "
Output: "Nguyễn Khánh Sơn"

Question 7: Extract Song Name from Path
• Requirement: Given a string that represents the path to a music file, for example:
d:\\music\\muabui.mp3, write two functions:
• One to extract "muabui.mp3"
• One to extract "muabui"
• Note: The path can be any song path, so the function must return the correct result for any
input.
