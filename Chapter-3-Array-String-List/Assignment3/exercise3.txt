Question 1: List Processing
Requirements: Write a program that allows:
• Initializing a list
• Adding elements to the list
• Entering a value k and checking how many times it appears in the list
• Calculating the sum of all prime numbers in the list
• Sorting the list
• Deleting the list

Question 2: Random List Processing
Requirements: Write a program that allows:
• Randomly initializing a list with n elements
• Inputting a value k and removing all elements in the list that are equal to k
• Checking whether the list is symmetric (palindromic)


Question 3: Multidimensional List Processing
Requirements: Write a program that allows: • Initializing and entering a matrix of M x N random elements • Displaying any row based on user input • Displaying any column based on user input • Displaying the maximum value in the matrix
Question 4: Determine Output When Executing List
Given the list:
lst = [3, 0, 1, 5, 2]
x = 2
What is the result of executing the following lines:
(a) lst[0]?
(b) lst[3]?
(c) lst[x]?
(d) lst[-x]?
(e) lst[x + 1]?
(f) lst[x] + 1?
(g) lst[lst[x]]?
(h) lst[lst[lst[x]]]?

Question 5: Determine Output When Executing List
Given the list:
lst = [20, 1, -34, 40, -8, 60, 1, 3]
What is the result of executing the following lines:
(a) lst
(b) lst[0:3]
(c) lst[4:8]
(d) lst[4:33]
(e) lst[-5:-3]
(f) lst[-22:3]
(g) lst[4:]
(h) lst[:] (i) lst[:4]
(j) lst[1:5]
(k)-34 in lst
(l)-34 not in lst
(m) len(lst)

Question 6: Array Processing
Requirements: Write a program that inputs an array of natural numbers. Display the following:
• Line 1: Odd numbers and the total count of odd numbers
• Line 2: Even numbers and the total count of even numbers
• Line 3: Prime numbers
• Line 4: Non-prime numbers
• Example:
M = [3, 6, 7, 8, 11, 17, 2, 90, 2, 5, 4, 5, 8]
→ 3, 7, 11, 17, 5 (2) → 6 odd numbers

Question 7: Matrix Processing
Requirements:
Input two matrices A and B
Add the two matrices
Write a function to compute the transpose of a matrix → apply it to both A and B.


Question 8: Reverse a list
Write a function void reverselist (int arr[], int size) that reverses the elements
of a list.
• Example: Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] → Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1].

Question 9: Find Maximum and Minimum in an Array
Write a program to find the maximum and minimum values in a onedimensional array.

Question 10: Magic Square Check
Write a program to check whether a given 3x3 matrix is a magic square. A
magic square has the same sum for all rows, columns, and diagonals.
